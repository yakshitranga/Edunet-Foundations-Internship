# EV Adoption Forecasting

Forecasting electric vehicle (EV) adoption helps city planners, policymakers, and infrastructure developers make smarter decisions—especially about charging station deployment and grid readiness.

## 📈 Overview

This project uses historical data and machine learning models to predict future EV adoption trends in urban areas. It aims to answer:

- How quickly are EVs being adopted in different regions?
- When will specific thresholds (e.g. 10%, 30%, 50% adoption) be reached?
- What kind of infrastructure growth will be needed to support this?

## 🛠️ Features

- Time-series forecasting using models like ARIMA and Prophet
- Data preprocessing and visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib
- Model evaluation with MAE and RMSE metrics
- Easy-to-interpret forecast plots
